This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It packages React for production with optimizations to enhance performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you're unhappy with the build tool and configuration options, you can `eject` at any point. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will move all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you complete control over them. All commands except `eject` will continue to work, but they will reference the copied scripts, allowing you to modify them. From this point onward, you're responsible for managing these configurations.

You don't need to use `eject`. The curated feature set is ideal for small to medium deployments, but if customization is required, you have the option. The command copies all config files and dependencies like webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc., into your project for full control. The other commands will still work but will point to the copied scripts for tweaking. This tool allows flexibility when you're ready for it.
